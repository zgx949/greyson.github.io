<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

Hi there! My name is Guoxiang Zheng (ÈÉëÂõΩÁõ∏), a sports and technology enthusiast, combining a background in physical education with a passion for artificial intelligence.

I am currently a first-year Master‚Äôs student in Artificial Intelligence at Shanghai University's School of Future Technology, and I hold a Bachelor's degree in Social Sports Guidance and Management (Education) and Computer Science and Technology (Engineering) from Jiangxi University of Finance and Economics. 

My research focuses on the intersection of sports and AI, particularly using Large Language Models (LLMs) for scenario generation, aiming to develop intelligent systems that simulate, analyze, and enhance sports performance.
